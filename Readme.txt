# This is done just for fun.
# I have implemented in C++ a small demo based on the amiga demoscene "Dots Landscape", 
# to practice a little bit in my free time with memory addresses and learn a little bit of SDL 2.0.
# The idea has been taken from here https://youtu.be/ObiLBAhY6dU?t=1m15s

# Edit genie.bat with your visual studio version and run the script.
